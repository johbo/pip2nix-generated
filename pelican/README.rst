 Pelican based blog
====================

At the moment I do not see a case to generate anything for Pelican, since this
is an example where the available things inside of Nixpkgs work out.

It's a question though how to handle cases when a custom extra package would be
needed or if a specific version would be needed.

I've added it here to leave it as a reminder that just because we can `pip2nix`
generate does not mean we always should do.
