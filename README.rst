===============================================
 Generated Nix environments for various things
===============================================

Mainly used as a collection of environments which are generated by `pip2nix`.

I do use these files to experiment with `pip2nix` and also to have some tools at
my fingertips whenever I need them. Please only use this for anything except
experimentation if you understand what you are doing.


Usage
=====

Using existing things should work via the normal Nix tooling, e.g. `nix-shell`
or `nix-build` and `nix-env`. See the `Nix manual`_ regarding more details and
the full background.

Example to spin up a shell with `devpi-server` being available::

  $ cd devpi
  $ nix-shell
  $ devpi-server --version
  4.2.1


Updates
=======

You'll need `pip2nix` available, currently it's best to look at it's repository
and go from there:

https://github.com/johbo/pip2nix

Usually inside of a directory, there is a `pip2nix.ini`, so that you can just
run the following command::

  $ pip2nix generate
